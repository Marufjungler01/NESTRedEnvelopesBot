## Background

Our development team has developed countless telegram bots for rewarding active users, which is a very exhausting job. Therefore, we decided to develop a general-purpose bot that can help members of the NEST community to distribute and receive NEST red packets in Telegram groups.

The goals for this repository are:

1. Record the receipt of NEST Prize
2. Export all the receipt data
3. Reduce the cost of reward distribution and reduce transaction errors
4. Anti cheating

## Install

This project uses a serverless architecture design, so you need to be familiar with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) related services, including: Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage

You need to replace some configuration in the source code, including:
1. Create a new Telegram bot account and configure its token in Lambda's environment variables
2. Modify the whitelist of administrators in the original code, ```WHITELIST```
3. Need to create a DynamoDB database
